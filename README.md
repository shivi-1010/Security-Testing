# Security Testing

This repository contains my academic work completed for the **Security Testing** course as part of the **Software Quality Assurance & Test Engineering** program at **Conestoga College**.

The work focuses on identifying, exploiting, analyzing, and mitigating security vulnerabilities in web applications using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## What This Repository Includes

### Vulnerability Assessment & Scanning
- Performed vulnerability assessments on intentionally vulnerable applications such as:
  - **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**
  - **OWASP Juice Shop**
- Identified common web vulnerabilities including:
  - Broken Authentication
  - Weak Password Mechanisms
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Security Misconfigurations

### Penetration Testing
- Conducted manual and automated penetration testing
- Executed attacks such as:
  - Brute-force login attacks
  - DOM-based XSS
  - Unauthorized access via request manipulation
- Validated exploit success through real application behavior

### Security Testing Tools
- **OWASP ZAP** – vulnerability scanning, fuzzing, brute-force testing
- **Burp Suite** – request interception, repeater, intruder attacks
- **Kali Linux** – testing environment
- Browser developer tools for client-side inspection

### Risk Assessment & Threat Modeling
- Applied **DREAD risk assessment model** to evaluate vulnerabilities:
  - Damage
  - Reproducibility
  - Exploitability
  - Affected Users
  - Discoverability
- Performed **Threat Modeling** for a fictional organization
- Prioritized risks and proposed mitigation strategies

### Security Reporting & Mitigation
- Documented findings in professional-style security reports
- Provided mitigation recommendations such as:
  - CAPTCHA and account lockout mechanisms
  - Strong password enforcement
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Access control improvements
  - Secure configuration practices
